%abstract english

You will write two abstracts for your thesis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first abstract will be written at the very beginning of your thesis.
	       It shall contain a description of the problem, you want to solve, and an approach, how you want to address that problem.

	      The purpose of this first abstract is to specify the topic of the thesis.
	      It is meant to reflect to the supervisor, how you have understood the task.
	      Also, it gives you the opportunity to define a focus or to add topics, that you are interested in, to the scope of your thesis.
	\item The second abstract will be the one, that is included in your thesis.
	      This abstract shall summarize your thesis in a way, that another researcher can decide, if reading your thesis provides valuable information for her/his work.
	      For this, you shall provide a short context, from which you derive a motivation for your thesis.
	      This is followed by stating the problem, that is approached in this thesis.
	      After the problem, you shall list the main methods, that were used to solve the problem.
	      If these methods are based on a widely known method, you should also mention, that this method alone was not an insufficent approach to your particular problem.
	      In the end, you shall summarize your most relevant results.
\end{itemize}
