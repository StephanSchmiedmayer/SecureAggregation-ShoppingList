\chapter{Main part}

Instead of adding a \textit{Main part} chapter, the work, that has been done in the thesis must be documented in multiple chapters.
However, the recommended structure of these chapters depends strongly on the topic of the thesis.
This chapter of the template describes some common examples of how a thesis could look like and recommends a structure of chapters for each of them.
Decide for yourself, which of the examples is closest to your thesis.
