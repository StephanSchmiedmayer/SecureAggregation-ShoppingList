\chapter{Discussion}
This chapter shall give a realistic assessment of the success of the research in this thesis.
Bear in mind, that failures are equally acceptable as successful research approaches.
Nevertheless, both cases require a reflection of what went right and what went wrong in order to estimate the impact of the thesis' result and to guide further research.
For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Did the chosen method yield the desired result?
	\item Has the developed software fulfilled all requirements?
	\item Are the conclusions from the analysis generalizable?
\end{itemize}
