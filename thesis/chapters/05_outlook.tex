\chapter{Outlook}

Often, the outlook is comprised in the summary.
However, sometimes it was a substantial part of the thesis to develop ideas, how the work of the thesis can be continued.
Also, it might have been necessary to leave out obvious research approaches in order to limit the thesis to a manageable scope.
In these cases, the outlook is probably so extensive, that it would dominate the summary, if it was not relocated to its own chapter.

It is recommended to start by summarizing the contributions of this thesis.
Then, you can discuss promising approaches, that were considered in the thesis, but not followed.
And finally, you can compare these approaches with ideas or visionary proposals, that might advance the research in the field, but which are not backed up by a solid foundation in the literature.
Be careful, that you only include serious proposals here, since ridiculous approaches will damage the credibility of the thesis.
So, justify, why these approaches may be applicable.
